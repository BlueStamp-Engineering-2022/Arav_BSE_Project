# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up the Ardiuno and the motor to check to see if my motor worked. I wrote a small code where it turns the motor 180 degrees from its orginal position, waits 2 seconds and then turns 180 degrees back to its orginal position. I had some trouble in the beggining figuring out how to stop void loops from going on continously.
